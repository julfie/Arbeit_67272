Arbeit 2014 :: 67-272
===
This is the current version of the Arbeit project using Rails 4.  It was originally conceived as an excuse to play around with the awesome Chronic gem and requires this gem to run.  It is currently being used to demonstrate some more advanced features in Rails, introduces multi-model forms, and uses some jQuery.  Refactoring is another major teaching objective with this project and there are some obvious code smells we will deal with later.  All said, it is clearly a work in progress and additional features will be added over the remainder of the semester.  

It does have its own populate file, so after migrating the database, you can simply run 'rake db:populate' to add fake (but somewhat realistic) data.  If you want to log in as an admin, use my email and the password 'secret'.  To log in as a regular member, pick any person in the system along with the password 'secret' and you should be able to get access.

There is a complete set of unit tests with Arbeit and a few wrinkles that we didn't have to deal with in the first half of the semester.  It may be worthwhile to read the unit tests first before looking at the models. (Remember our discussion of testing as a form of documentation? -- why not see how helpful the tests are to you in that regard.)

Of course, the project also has several 'Easter eggs' for those who are willing to take the time to explore and learn.  Enjoy!
